//! # Game State Management
//!
//! This module defines a `GameState` struct that manages game-related flags such as life, score, and game status.
//! It provides methods for initializing and resetting the game state.
//!
//! # Example
//! ```rust
//! use game::GameState;
//!
//! let mut state = GameState::new(3); // Initialize game with 3 lives
//! assert_eq!(state.life, 3);
//! assert_eq!(state.score, 0);
//! assert_eq!(state.status, GameStatus::Playing);
//!
//! state.reset(); // Reset game state
//! assert_eq!(state.life, 3);
//! assert_eq!(state.score, 0);
//! ```
//!
